title: More than a Password Day 2024
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

Welcome to the annual More than a Password Day! To celebrate this year's event, OWASP is enabling multi-factor authentication across the OWASP Foundation's infrastructure. This is a significant step forward in securing our systems and data. At the start of this year's event, we had only 21% of all OWASP accounts enrolled in MFA. We're aiming to increase this to 100% by the end of the year.

## How to enable multi-factor authentication on your account

If you haven't yet enabled multi-factor authentication, just sign in today and follow the prompts. If you already have MFA enabled, you're all set!

## How to run a security check on your OWASP account

We recommend you run a security check on your account to ensure your account is secure.

## Use password-free authentication

Simpler to use and far more secure than passwords, passkeys use cryptographic to prove that you are you. Once enrolled in Google MFA, you can enroll in passkeys.  

## Secure your email account

Email is the most common form of resetting your password. Add extra security to deter access to your accounts:

- Strong password (long, randomly generated and unique)
- Multi-factor authentication / two-step verification  

Password managers allow you to have unique, strong passwords for each site, and can help you identify weak or reused passwords.

## Add layers of security

Additional security measures can help prevent phishing and other attacks, if used in addition to your password.

- A hardware security key (or token)
- An authenticator app  

Password managers often come with a built-in authenticator app, which can be used to secure your accounts.

## Use a password manager

- Using a password manager means you can use strong, randomly generated, harder to guess passwords.
- Use a strong, memorable password manager password.  

## Use a technique or passphrases to pick passwords

- Use "three random words" or passphrases to pick passwords that are easier to remember but hard to guess.

## Hacked? Move fast to change passwords

Your passwords should be changed immediately if:

- One of your devices is compromised
- If an online site or service you use is hacked

Using random unique passwords with a password manager means you only need to change breached passwords. Many password managers can help you identify which passwords need changing.
