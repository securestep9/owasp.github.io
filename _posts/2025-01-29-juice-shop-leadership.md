## Project Leadership x2

Effective immediately, [Jannik Hollenbach](https://infosec.exchange/@jannik) joins [Bjoern Kimminich](https://bsky.app/profile/bkimminich.bsky.social) as co-project lead of the OWASP Juice Shop. Jannik has been an an active contributor to the project for many years. His achievements include developing the [MultiJuicer](https://github.com/juice-shop/multi-juicer) hosting-platform, building the [Hacking Instructor](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part1/challenges.html#_hacking_instructor) mechanism for our in-app tutorials, and fully re-creating the Score Board in a modern tile-based layout.

Lacking a second project leader was an open topic of OWASP Juice Shop since a new release of the [Project Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/projects) in 2021. Not only are we now addressing this compliance issue, but an operational continuity issue as well. 

## Enhanced contributor engagement

Read on to learn more about our latest steps to enhance the contributor engagement with OWASP Juice Shop for everyone, independent of experience and level of involvement.

### Monthly contributor meeting now public

We always considered our **Juice Shop Developer Meeeting** on Google Meet open for all past, current, and future contributors. But we totally failed to advertise it actively, which changes now:

The **Juice Shop Developer Meeting** is scheduled **every two weeks on Tuesday at 19:00-19:45 CET/CEST**. You can find the meeting series on the [OWASP Event Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=hl6cjgs6ep1h7oniqgueu2bhbo%40group.calendar.google.com). For an invitation to the series, reach out to me [via email](mailto:bjoern.kimminich@owasp.org) or a direct message on Slack and include your email address to invite. You can also just hop on spontaneously as we intened to post the Google Meet link on Slack as a reminder shortly before the meeting starts.

### Contributor Slack channel

We maintain two public channels on the official [OWASP Slack](https://owasp.org/slack/invite) server, first of all the main community channel [`project-juiceshop`](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C255XSY04) for questions, ideas and feedback. Second, the [`juiceshop-dev`](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/CCGNHE0F4) channel where CI/CD pipeline and test automation results are posted by bots.

For contributors, we have a dedicated private channel [`juiceshop-contributors`](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C05SF88UU73), which you can easily join by pinging `@bkimminich` or `@Jannik` in the public main channel or by sending either a direct message. We will, for now, not make this channel public to avoid it getting used by accident for support questions and other topics the [`project-juiceshop`](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C255XSY04) channel is meant for.

### Google Summer of Code 2025

Juice Shop successfully participates in GSoC [under the OWASP umbrella](https://owasp.org/www-community/initiatives/gsoc/gsoc2025) since 2018. We provide true mentorship to our students, with weekly meetings for the ideation & feedback cycles, and 1:1 sessions on demand for troubleshooting or pair programming. You can find the overview of all our previous projects on [our official references](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/REFERENCES.md#googlesummerofcode) page.

In 2025, Juice Shop again promotes [several project ideas](https://owasp.org/www-community/initiatives/gsoc/gsoc2025ideas#owasp-juice-shop) to prospective students. In addition to the projects proposed by the team, we are open to suggestions of entirely new project ideas. Feel free to pitch yours directly to the listed mentor team!

Please note that the most successful GSoC projects usually come from students who have already contributed to the project before, so if you are interested in GSoC, start contributing now! Make sure to read our [Contribution Guidelines](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part3/contribution.html) and optionally our [Codebase 101](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/part3/codebase.html) for newcomers.

## Simplified contributor recognition

With the above leadership and process changes, we are effeectively abandoning the term "Core Team" from our website and repositories. Every contributor should feel like a team member, regardless of their level of involvement. We will continue to publish regular updates of our top contributor diagram based on `git-stats` into our [Hall of Fame](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/HALL_OF_FAME.md#github-contributors):

The top-translators in our [CrowdIn project](https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop) will also continue to be recognized on the [Hall of Fame](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/HALL_OF_FAME.md#translators) of our main repository. 

Repository and GitHub org level admin and maintainer permissions will remain reserved for the project leaders and hand-selected trusted contributors like our former "Core Team" members, top-contributors, and GSoC mentors Timo Pagel & Shubbam Palriwala.
