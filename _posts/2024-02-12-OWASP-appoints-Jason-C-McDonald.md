Jason C. McDonald's passion for communication permeates everything he does. As a speaker, a mentor, and the author of “Dead Simple Python”, as well as various fiction novels, he lives to encourage and empower others to reach their full potential. He draws from over a decade of experience as a software engineer and manager to bring calm to chaos. Outside of work, he can often be found clattering away on his typewriter in one of his favorite local coffee shops. Otherwise, he's probably out gardening, walking his dogs, and just enjoying being at home in Minnesota.
