The [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project](https://asvs.owasp.org) held it's first ever, in-person, community meetup during last week's [Global AppSec Lisbon](https://lisbon.globalappsec.org/) conference. This was an exciting opportunity for anyone interested in the project to come and meet some of the leaders, discover how to get involved and learn about our upcoming plans. We are super grateful to our friends at [Jit](https://jit.io) for their supporting in running the event.

This post is a quick summary of the meetup including key information on how you can get involved!

## tl;dr

If you don't want to read all the blurb and just want to get involved, you can either:

* See [a list of some issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whuC4kfUwwiBRGP14um_IC5mOquawqFxtxWsF9Pf-Kk/edit?usp=drivesdk) where you could get started with working on the standard.
* See [a list of tasks/job roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUgbA1xjwRaOL9o8SYQqoGGrFNNobmid_FGS-ELVAzA/edit) which are not directly connected to writing the standard but would help us a lot and [a form to fill out if you are interested](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSda9V7dJ6h-YVsVRogi1hJGlhDANZXdUUyk7XQuaPpscKv2Bg/viewform?usp=send_form).

## The talks

As you can see from [our agenda](https://owaspglobalappseclisbon2024.sched.com/overview/type/ASVS+Community+Meetup), we had several talks planned as well as some informal discussion time as well.

[Jim Manico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmanico/) kicked off the morning with a freestyle overview about the ASVS, giving some background and context on the project to anyone who might not be familar with it. This was followed by [Daniel Cuthbert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-cuthbert0x/) dialing in from the UK to give us an update on his outreach efforts with various public sector organisations and government departments to get them to incorporate ASVS in their guidance and regulation.

To finish off the first set of talks, [I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcgrossman/) gave an overview of the [guiding principles for version 5.0](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/wiki/Roadmap-to-version-5.0#key-objectives), talked through our goal to release 5.0 by the end of this year, and provided some more information on how you can get more involved (more on this below).

After a break for informal discussions and then lunch, we came back to hear a fascinating talk from [Irene Michlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irene221b/) and [Aleksas Spiridenkovas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksas-spiridenkovas-238a8a2/) about [how they used Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/asvs-security-graph-chatbot/) to get better responses from a Chatbot when asking it which ASVS requirements would be useful for a new software requirement or feature

Talks about applying the ASVS are always popular and this was no exception!

<br/>
## Discussions

We were able to have a number of discussions with current or potential users of ASVS in between the talks and over lunch. These discussions continued after the meetup as well, over both days of the conference and gave us some great feedback and ideas for taking the project forwards.

<br/>
## Opportunities to get Involved

One of the key aims of the meetup was to get more people involved in the project. The more people who give their input, the better the quality of the guidance in the standard. Plus, if more people get involved in running the project itself, it makes it easier for the project leaders to push things forward.

To that end, I had printed out a couple of posters to stick around the meetup to let people know how they could get involved. (You can see them dotted around the room in the pictures above).

If you want to get involved you can take a look at them here:

* The "WANTED" poster, [a list of some issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whuC4kfUwwiBRGP14um_IC5mOquawqFxtxWsF9Pf-Kk/edit?usp=drivesdk) where you could get started with working on the standard (plus you get to enjoy my puns).
* The "Volunteer" poster, [a list of tasks/job roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUgbA1xjwRaOL9o8SYQqoGGrFNNobmid_FGS-ELVAzA/edit) which are not directly connected to writing the standard but would help us a lot and [a form to fill out if you are interested](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSda9V7dJ6h-YVsVRogi1hJGlhDANZXdUUyk7XQuaPpscKv2Bg/viewform?usp=send_form).

After the meetup, I also stuck the posters up in some other locations around the conference as well. Thanks to [Starr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/starr-brown-8837547/) for the idea and also for helping us get set up and also to [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samstepanyan/) for publicising that on Twitter which got us enquiries from people who weren't at the conference!

We have plenty of contributor stickers left to give out as well so earn yours today ðŸ˜€).

## Next steps

We are super excited by the success and popularity of this event and the interest in the ASVS. We are currently thinking about organising a virtual version to bring this type of meetup to a wider audience.
