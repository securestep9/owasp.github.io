The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Our programming includes:

- Community-led open source projects including code, documentation, and standards
- Over 250+ local chapters worldwide
- Tens of thousands of members

We are an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. The OWASP Foundation launched on December 1st, 2001, becoming incorporated as a United States non-profit charity on April 21, 2004.
